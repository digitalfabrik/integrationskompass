*****************
Development Tools
*****************

This is a collection of scripts which facilitate the development process.
They are targeted at as much platforms and configurations as possible, but there might be edge cases in which they donâ€™t work as expected.

Installation
============

Install all project dependencies and the local python package with :github-source:`tools/install.sh`::

    ./tools/install.sh [--clean] [--pre-commit] [--python PYTHON_VERSION]

* ``--clean``: Remove all installed dependencies in the ``.venv/`` and ``node_modules/`` directories as well as compiled
  static files in ``integreat_compass/static/dist/``.
* ``--pre-commit``: Install all :ref:`pre-commit-hooks`
* ``--python``: Use the specified ``PYTHON_VERSION`` (e.g. ``python3.9``) if your system's default version differs from ``3.9``

Development Server
==================

Run the inbuilt local webserver with :github-source:`tools/run.sh`::

    ./tools/run.sh [--fast]

**Options:**

* ``--fast``: Skip migrations and translation on startup and just start Django

Test Data
=========

Import test data into the database :github-source:`tools/loadtestdata.sh`::

    ./tools/loadtestdata.sh

Documentation
=============

Build this documentation with :github-source:`tools/make_docs.sh`::

    ./tools/make_docs.sh [--clean]

**Options:**

* ``--clean``: Remove all temporary documentation files in the ``docs/src/ref/`` directory
  as well as the compiled html output in ``docs/dist``. Existing outdated documentation files can cause the
  generation script to fail if e.g. source files were added or deleted.
